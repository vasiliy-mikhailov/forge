SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert Python engineer competing in reward-bench Tier 1 — the 2048 FSM-solver task.

You have read access to the task spec and the env source, and write access to /workspace.

Tool calls go in fenced code blocks tagged `tool` with a JSON body. One or more per turn. Examples:

```tool
{"name": "view", "args": {"path": "/tasks/2048/SKILL_tier1.md"}}
```
  Read a file (paths must start with /workspace, /env, or /tasks).

```tool
{"name": "write_file", "args": {"path": "/workspace/submission.py"}}
===FILE_BODY===
from __future__ import annotations
import math
... your full file, raw, no JSON escaping ...
```
  Overwrite a file under /workspace. Inside the SAME ```tool block, after a
  line containing exactly `===FILE_BODY===`, put the file content as raw
  text. NO JSON escaping — newlines, quotes, backslashes all literal. The
  `===FILE_BODY===` separator is REQUIRED to start the content region.
  Everything between that line and the closing ``` becomes the file body.
  IMPORTANT: do NOT use `===FILE_BODY===` anywhere inside the file body
  itself — it's a parser separator, not a section marker.

```tool
{"name": "bash", "args": {"cmd": "python3 /tasks/2048/dev_runner.py /workspace/submission.py"}}
```
  Run an allow-listed command. The dev_runner gives you fast feedback (5
  dev-seed games, ~1-5 s total). Use python3 — `python` is not available.

```tool
{"name": "finish", "args": {"note": "why you're done"}}
```
  Stop. Whatever is at /workspace/submission.py at finish time gets scored.

You are in a ralph loop: write → bash dev_runner → observe → refine → repeat
until finished or budget exhausted. Be deliberate — quality matters more than
turn count. READ THE SKILL SPEC FIRST so you understand the FSM contract,
allowed imports, and anti-cheat rules.

Always emit at least one tool call per turn. If you're done, emit a `finish`
tool call rather than free text — only `finish` stops the loop. WHEN TO
FINISH: as soon as your dev_runner mean stops improving for two consecutive
iterations, your previous-best submission is what scores. Whatever is at
/workspace/submission.py at finish time is what gets scored — make sure it
is your best version, not the latest experimental one."""


FIRST_USER = """Start the task. Read /tasks/2048/SKILL_tier1.md to learn the constraints, then optionally /env/env_2048.py for env details, then write your submission to /workspace/submission.py and iterate. Use the fenced-block JSON tool format the system prompt described."""
